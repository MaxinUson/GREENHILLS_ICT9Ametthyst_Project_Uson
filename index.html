			<td class="table-dark">Smoke alarms can alert you to a fire in your home in time for you to escape, even if you are sleeping.Install alarms on every level of your home, outside each sleeping area and in each sleeping area. Test each alarm every month, following the manufacturer’s directions, and replace batteries once a year, or whenever an alarm “chirps” to signal a low battery. Replace alarms more than 10 years old</td>

			<td class="table-dark">    If a fire breaks out in your home, you have to get out fast. To prepare, sit down with your family and agree on an escape plan.Be sure that everyone knows at least two unobstructed exits — doors and windows — from every room. (If you live in an apartment building, do not include elevators in your escape plan.) Decide on a meeting place outside where everyone will meet after they escape.
    Have your entire household practice your escape plan at least twice a year.</td>

Keep portable and space heaters at least three feet away from anything that can burn. Keep children and pets away from heaters and never leave heaters on when you leave home or go to bed.Teach your children that matches and lighters are tools, not toys, and should be used only by adults or with adult supervision.</td>
